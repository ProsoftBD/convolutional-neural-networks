This is a code for beginning to experiment with Convolutional neural Networks. 

Download the Dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3X8tp-oOsc8YUI3eHM0SW02SVU?usp=sharing 
and place it in a folder /datasets within the folder where the cnn.py file is placed. 

Make sure to keep the internal folder structure of the folders of the dataset intact. 

I'll keep updating this repository.
